# BMC-RLM-Community-Automations

## Purpose
This is an open repository for anyone to share their BMC Release Lifecycle Management automations.

## Format
The repo is currently separated into two product directories:
* RPM - BMC Release Process Management automations
* RPD - BMC Release Package and Deployment actions

Under the respective product directory, you can simply create a descriptive folder for either an application suite (ex. jboss) or a specific application (ex. jboss-enterprise-application-platform).   Please label your automations with the OS (ex. *-linux or *-windows), and if possible, please mention the system that you were integrating with in the check-in comments (ex. I was integrating with JBoss EAP 6.3 GA running on Linux)
